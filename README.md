# Dotfiles
This is my configuration file from kitty, zsh, and wayland ecosystem for my arch linux system. I will update this repository as I make changes to the configurations that I find necessary or useful.

## Current status

> **Note:** Currently, these configuration files are not fully scriptable or automatically installed like most dotfiles. You will need to manually copy or link the configuration files to their respective locations. I plan to automate the installation process in the future, but for now, this setup requires manual intervention.

# Acknowledgements

Some of the configurations in this repository have been inspired by or borrowed from the dotfiles of another user. These are his [dotfiles](https://github.com/typecraft-dev/dotfiles.git).
